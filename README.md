## Browser Support

- Firefox 54+
- Chrome 51+
- Edge 79+
- Safari 10+

## Getting Started

To use the polyfill, add this script tag to your document `<head>`:

```js
<script type="module">
  if (!("anchorName" in document.documentElement.style)) {
    import("https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning");
  }
</script>
```

If you want to manually apply the polyfill, you can instead import the
`polyfill` function directly from the
`@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning/dist/css-anchor-positioning-fn.js` file.

For build tools such as Vite, Webpack, and Parcel, that will look like this:

```js
import polyfill from '@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning/fn';
```

The `polyfill` function returns a promise that resolves when the polyfill has
been applied.

You can view a more complete demo [here](https://anchor-polyfill.netlify.app/).

## Configuration

The polyfill accepts one argument (type: `boolean`, default: `false`), which
determines whether anchor calculations should [update on every animation
frame](https://floating-ui.com/docs/autoUpdate#animationframe) (e.g. when the
anchor element is animated using `transform`s), in addition to always updating
on scroll/resize. While this option is optimized for performance, it should be
used sparingly.

```js
<script type="module">
  if (!("anchorName" in document.documentElement.style)) {
    const { default: polyfill } = await import("https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning/dist/css-anchor-positioning-fn.js");

    polyfill(true);
  }
</script>
```

When using the default version of the polyfill that executes automatically, this
option can be set by setting the value of
`window.UPDATE_ANCHOR_ON_ANIMATION_FRAME`.

```js
<script type="module">
  if (!("anchorName" in document.documentElement.style)) {
    window.UPDATE_ANCHOR_ON_ANIMATION_FRAME = true;
    import("https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning");
  }
</script>
```

## Limitations

This polyfill was implemented against an early version of the spec, and updates
were paused to allow the syntax to solidify. Now that browsers are working on
implementation, we would like to bring it up to date.

While this polyfill supports many basic use cases, it doesn't (yet) support the
following features:

- The `@position-try` rule
- The `position-try-options`, `position-try-order`, or `position-try` properties
- `anchor-scope` property
- `inset-area` property
- `anchor-center` value for `justify-self`, `align-self`, `justify-items`, and
  `align-items` properties
- anchor functions with `implicit` anchor-element
- automatic anchor positioning: anchor functions with `inside` or `outside`
  anchor-side
- `position-visibility` property
- dynamically added/removed anchors or targets
- anchors or targets in the shadow-dom
- anchor functions assigned to `inset-*` properties or `inset` shorthand
  property
- vertical/rtl writing-modes (partial support)

In addition, JS APIs like `CSSPositionTryRule` or `CSS.supports` will not be
polyfilled.
